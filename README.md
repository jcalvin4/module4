# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database.  Describe how to use your program.}
I wrote a program capable of Adding, Removing, Editing, and Viewing Data in the Database using python. I set up the environment by installing the firebase admin and importing all the necessary programs for setting up the connection.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database
I am using Firestore. It is a cloud database run by google. They provide a lot of information to help the developer with connecting to your database through various different languages.

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
My Database structure uses 4 fields per document. One for Hike Name, Distance, Location by State, and times completed. 
The database is easy to read as well as access.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used VS code and installed the firebase admin.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used python. I tried javascript at first, but it felt like jumping into a bottomless pit. Python was easier to work and after a brief review I got things figured out.
